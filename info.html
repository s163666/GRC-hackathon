    <p>Menstrual Maze is a game committed to destigmatizing periods and raising awareness about period poverty. A major problem people face globally is an inability to access period products. Period products are expensive and millions of young people are left struggling without them. Not only that, but many individuals arenâ€™t educated about periods before getting their own.<br>This issue has recently come under scrutiny after Florida introduced legislature to ban conversation about periods in elementary schools. This highlights the need for increased awareness and education as the key to promoting gender equity globally.<br></p>
