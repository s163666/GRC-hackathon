    <p>Menstrual Maze is a game committed to destigmatizing periods and raising awareness about period poverty. A major problem women and other people with uteruses face globally is an inability to access period products. Period products are expensive and millions of young girls are left struggling without them. Not only that, but many young girls arenâ€™t educated about periods before getting their own. Especially considering that the Florida legislature is making moves to ban conversation about periods in elementary schools, raising awareness and educating the population is key to promoting gender equity globally.</p>
